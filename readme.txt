This is my third PyGame based game project.

This time, I focused more on large sprite groups, advanced collision detection and - especially - 2.5D elements (sprites overlapping,
dynamic sprite scaling, ...).

The graphics are made in combination of using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop (I did themself entirely by myself even tho they are heavily inspired by Nintendoâ„¢ originals).

It took me about two and a half months to complete the project with an active working time of about 70 hours in total (code, game-logic, and graphics). (and surely a few more gallons of coffee...)

Please consider the docstring of the main.py file for some further information.
